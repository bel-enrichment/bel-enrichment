BEL Enrichment
==============
A package for generating curation sheets for rationally enriching a BEL graph using INDRA [1]_ and PyBEL [2]_.

Installation
------------
``bel_enrichment`` can be installed from directly GitHub with the following command:

.. code-block:: bash

   $ pip install git+https://github.com/cthoyt/bel-enrichment.git

Usage
-----
Generate a folder full of curation sheets based on the given BEL graph that has been pre-compiled by PyBEL.
Use ``--info-cutoff`` to specify the minimum information density cutoff. 1.0 means that the node has no edges, .5 means
one edge, and so on. Use ``--belief-cutoff`` to specify the minimum belief score from INDRA for adding the statement
to the sheet. Higher belief means the more chance a statement is already right.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bel-enrichment make_sheet zhang2011.bel --directory ~/Desktop/zhang-enrichment

Generate a ranking for genes based on the information content in a given BEL graph that has been pre-compiled by PyBEL.

.. code-block:: bash

   $ bel-enrichment ranks zhang2011.bel
